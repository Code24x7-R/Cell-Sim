Cellular Colony Evolution Simulation
An interactive 3D simulation of competing cellular colonies with light/dark cycles, food sources, and various interactions. This will use Three.js for the 3D visualization and a simple HTML/CSS interface.

## features

This enhanced simulation now includes a comprehensive set of evolutionary adaptations:

* Specialized Adhesion: Cells produce adhesion proteins for stable multicellular structures
* Biofilm Formation: Cells secrete extracellular matrix forming protective communities
* External Skeletons: Protective structures for defense against predators
* Cell Specialization: Differentiation into specialized cell types with specific functions
* Digestive Systems: Specialized cells for efficient nutrient breakdown
* Internal Transport: Nutrient distribution channels throughout colonies
* Sexual Reproduction: Genetic material exchange through conjugation
* Spore Production: Durable spores for survival in harsh conditions
* Cell Communication: Signaling mechanisms to coordinate behavior
* Homeostasis: Maintaining internal stability in changing environments.
