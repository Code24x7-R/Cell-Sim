# Cell-Sim

Cell-Sim is a Cellular Colony Evolution Simulation (CCES).
An interactive 3D simulation of competing cellular colonies with light/dark cycles, food sources, and various interactions. This will use Three.js for the 3D visualization and a simple HTML/CSS interface.

## Goals

To create a CCES package in a single html for easy deployment on desktop, notebook, phone and tablet. 
Note that while based on life science, it is just a sim. ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

This simulation includes a comprehensive set of evolutionary adaptations.

* Specialized Adhesion: Cells produce adhesion proteins for stable multicellular structures
* Biofilm Formation: Cells secrete extracellular matrix forming protective communities
* External Skeletons: Protective structures for defense against predators
* Cell Specialization: Differentiation into specialized cell types with specific functions
* Digestive Systems: Specialized cells for efficient nutrient breakdown
* Internal Transport: Nutrient distribution channels throughout colonies
* Sexual Reproduction: Genetic material exchange through conjugation
* Spore Production: Durable spores for survival in harsh conditions
* Cell Communication: Signaling mechanisms to coordinate behavior
* Homeostasis: Maintaining internal stability in changing environments.
